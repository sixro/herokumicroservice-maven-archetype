I created this archetype in order to be able to create a microservice and deploy on Heroku as soon as I can.  
Of course I've made choices that could not fit with your experience/idea/etc...  
There are alternatives to this page. For example you can follow the [guide provided by Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploy-a-java-web-application-that-launches-with-jetty-runner).
